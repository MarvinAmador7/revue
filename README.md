# Revue.io

[revue.io](https://revue.io) is the github code presentation-review tool
based on the idea of @thejameskyle library
[spectacle-code-slide](https://github.com/thejameskyle/spectacle-code-slide)

It allows you to create edit and share
nice looking descriptive reviews of any code published on github.

Use arrow keys or spacebar (shift spacebar) to navigate.   
Click on edit button (in one of top corners) to start edit.

Please use [permalinks](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/)
to [code lines](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2015/07/25/sharing-line-highlights-in-github-files)
(_[revue.io](https://revue.io) caches github files
to avoid overrate [github api](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/)_)

# Languages support

For now it supports languages I selected - Javascript, Typescript, Sass, Scss, C++ etc...   
But it could support any language supported by [Prism](http://prismjs.com/).
Add language you need [here](https://github.com/istarkov/revue/blob/master/src/prism/utils/languages.js)
and provide a PR.

# Awesome reviews

(_Here could be your code review link_)

# Install

```bash
yarn install
# dev version
PORT=3000 yarn run start
# open browser at localhost:3000
# dev version but with NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000 yarn run start:prod
# ---------------------------------------
# production version build and server
yarn run build
PORT=3000 yarn run start:server
```

# How to use with private repos

To use with private repositaries you need to create
your github personal access token https://github.com/settings/tokens

Then start production or development version of this repo
with `GITHUB_USER_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable defined as `${USERNAME}:${TOKEN}`.

Example

```shell
GITHUB_USER_AUTH_TOKEN='vasyapupkin:e3150a4dca108b' PORT=3000 yarn run start:prod
```

One problem you could get with this solution,
that the code description (_not the code itself_) will be published
on a public `goo.gl` server,
so if your security does not allow you to publish something like this

```markdown
https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react/blob/master/src/google_map.js#L154-158

# Super code
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
...
```

you could provide a PR to this project with your `save/load` api solution,
or just save editor content locally as it's just plain txt file.

(_For now this project uses goo.gl url shortener as a free high availability database_)
